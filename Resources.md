## Using Github on Your Desktop

### Github Desktop App

In the presentation, we demonstrated how to use GitHub functions using the GitHub Desktop app. We recommend using this application for getting started with using GitHub. The set-up process for the GitHub Desktop App is relatively simple and it can be used with any coding language (e.g. R, Python, MatLab, etc.).

### GitHub Integration with R Studio

For those of you who primarily code using the R programming language, it is also possible to integrate GitHub with R Studio. There are more initial steps to complete in order to set up this integration. However, this might be a good option for you if you primarily use R and R Studio. We do not demonstrate how to set up this integration or its functionality in our presentation. However, if you are interested, we linked resources below that provide more details about how to set up and use GitHub within R Studio.
